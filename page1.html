        <h3> Best Time to Visit </h3>
        <p> The best time to go to South Korea is spring (March–May) or autumn (September–November). Both of these seasons offer fantastic weather and natural beauty. Winter (December–February) is also a good time to go for winter sports. </p>

        <h3> Not Recommended Time to Visit </h3>
        <p> June, July and August offer the best conditions for hiking, but the weather is hot and humid away from the mountains. Winters in South Korea are bitterly cold, so we wouldn't recommend visiting in December, January or February. It's important to take local holidays into account when planning your trip. </p>
