          <h3> Continent </h3>
          <p> 
            Korea is a 750-mile-long (1,200-kilometer-long) peninsula located in the easternmost part of the Asian continent. Today, the country is split into South and North Korea, but in the minds of most of its citizens, it remains a single nation that cannot be divided.

        <h3> Koreans Respect Rules </h3>
        <p> 
          In Korea, people love to have a good time, and they also love entertainment. But they are not crossing the line—pun intended. Even in bustling Seoul, you will rarely see non-tourists jaywalking or misbehaving. It’s part of the identity and the culture not to cause too much trouble or problems for others. </p>
