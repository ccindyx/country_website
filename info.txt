Food #1
 (Bimkap)This tasty mixed rice bowl is usually topped with veggies, an egg, hot pepper sauce and sliced steak. Mix it all together with chopsticks for a messy, flavoursome and relatively healthy meal.

Food #2
(eomuk) Called eomuk or odeng in Korean, these fishcakes are a favourite Korean food with locals. I can’t say I was fully sold. They had a chewy, processed texture and not a whole load of flavour but maybe that’s just the difference between Western and Eastern palates.

Food #3
(Ssam) Ssam means wrapped, therefore ssambap is a collection of bite-sized dishes wrapped in large green leaves: a waste-free (and washing up-free) eating style!

#1
The best time to go to South Korea is spring (March–May) or autumn (September–November). Both of these seasons offer fantastic weather and natural beauty. Winter (December–February) is also a good time to go for winter sports.

June, July and August offer the best conditions for hiking, but the weather is hot and humid away from the mountains. Winters in South Korea are bitterly cold, so we wouldn't recommend visiting in December, January or February. It's important to take local holidays into account when planning your trip.

Continent #1
Korea is a 750-mile-long (1,200-kilometer-long) peninsula located in the easternmost part of the Asian continent. Today, the country is split into South and North Korea, but in the minds of most of its citizens, it remains a single nation that cannot be divided.

Fun Fact #1
Koreans respect rules
In Korea, people love to have a good time, and they also love entertainment. But they are not crossing the line—pun intended. Even in bustling Seoul, you will rarely see non-tourists jaywalking or misbehaving. It’s part of the identity and the culture not to cause too much trouble or problems for others.
